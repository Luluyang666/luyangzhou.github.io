# Welcome to Luyang Zhou's Website

Hello! I am **Luyang Zhou 周路阳**, a PhD student at the University of York.

## About Me

My research focuses on doctor-patient interactions, with a particular interest in pediatric consultations. 

I also explore multimodal conversation analysis (CA), investigating how non-verbal cues, gestures, and visual elements contribute to communication in healthcare settings.
